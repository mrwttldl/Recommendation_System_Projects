##  :file_folder:  Business Problem
 
Association Rule was one of the first techniques used in data mining.Today, these rules are also referred to as the "Recommendation System".
It aims to make predictions about future sales by analyzing the patterns of transactions in the past and using this information.It is a rule-based machine learning technique.It reveals the rules of being together with certain probabilities. “Which products are sold together?” It helps us find the answer to the question.
Some usage areas:

* Catalog designs
* Product placement on the shelves of stores
* Creating customer profiles
* Campaign preparation

In our project, we use the retail data set, which is the e-commerce data set we used in previous projects. Our aim in this project is to suggest products to users at the basket stage.
